this is a minimalist Bankist app that I created for my JavaScript Course
you can log in to the website by these userNames : 
UserName : im , password : 1741
UserName : js , password : 1111

also if you want to see the first Script codes in action :
1. comment the whole codes in script2.js
2. uncomment the whole codes in script.js

also there are some codding challenges that i did for my course ( all of them are about advance topics of working with arrays in Javascript )
